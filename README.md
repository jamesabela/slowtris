# slowtris
This is a variation on Tetris. What if you had all the time in the world to choose where to put the blocks. This is meant to be a bit of fun.

I used the [Tetris](https://github.com/olemb/tetris/) as the start point to help with the code.

Perhaps somebody might thnk there are insights to be gained on this as a psychological experiment.
